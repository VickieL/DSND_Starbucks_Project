## Project Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>

Based on simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app, this project is going to analysis and determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type. Also based on the data, we can determine which offer is best for a given customer. With that, we can save cost on offers which no need to push (save SMS fee for example), and better design the offers by understanding our customers. So the project mainly contains 2 parts:

A. Analysis part: analysis data to get some insights on which demographic groups respond best to which offer type.
B. Modeling Part: build model to determine which offer is best for a given customer.
